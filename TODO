Axiom::Dict->copy v. clone
- prove E(a, 1)

Stabilise enough to write tests

Reduce explicit rules to just the rule name, discover the rest.
Remove explicit rules entirely, discover them.
Discover rules even when we take multiple steps.

Sets, type checking.

Abstract out knowledge of operators:
- arg number and types, return type
- rules
- constructing the grammar will be hard

Optionally: assume default .aa extension.
Load axioms/theorems from library (eg sum identities)
